### [Dashboard Live Demo](https://project.novypro.com/ucHUr8)

## Project Overview
The project involved developing an interactive dashboard with three main tabs: Home, Category, and Customer. The Home Tab provides a comprehensive overview of key business metrics, including revenue, sales trends, and average order value, offering a snapshot of overall performance and identifying top-performing regions. The Category Tab focuses on analyzing product performance, displaying sales distribution by size, top states for each category, and category-specific trends, which helps in guiding inventory and marketing strategies. The Customer Tab segments data by B2B and B2C channels, revealing customer preferences, shipping service distribution, and regional sales patterns, enabling targeted customer strategies. The analysis identified a recent decline in revenue, leading to the suggestion of actionable measures such as inventory optimization, enhancing customer satisfaction, and offering competitive expedited shipping rates to improve efficiency and drive growth.
